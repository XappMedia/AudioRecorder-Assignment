## Android Developer Homework Assignment

Develop an SDK that records audio and saves the data locally on the device.  Clone this repo as a starting point however do not fork or post online, others will have the same assignment.  In addition to meeting the basic requirements, we are looking for cleanliness and ease of use.

The `app` module is the harness that is already setup with the `audiorecorder` (the SDK) as a dependency.

### Requirements

1. The SDK `audiorecorder` can record audio and save the audio locally to the device
1. The Harness (`app`) gives hooks to the SDKs functionality for testing

### Extra

1. Javadocs
1. Unit Tests
1. Static Analysis

## Submission Instructions

Please archive the entire project and upload to Google Drive (or similar) and submit the shareable link.  

## Other

* We highly recommend using Android Studio.
* We expect you to make assumptions on how to record audio to make it as simple as possible.
* Think of the target consumer for the SDK to be voice memo application developers.
